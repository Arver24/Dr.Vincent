    <ul>
      <li>As there was a time during second wave, when unfortunately the beds in hospital were not avaliable due to large number of covid positive cases, then only person, who were in very critical position were able to get a get for treatment. The also has hostpitals, which will fully hear the player only if their health is below a certain level.(about 20% of max-health)</li>
      <li>The resources in game are not constantly respawning but are actually limited as were resources in pandemic in real world.</li>
      <li>There is a lot more, play and find out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Easter Eggs</h4>
    <details><summary>This spoils a lot. Open at your own risk.</summary><p>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the collectable items in game is <STRONG>Apple</STRONG>, and since main character is a Doctor, so consuming apple actually hurts the doctor XD.</li>
        <li>Although Apple also increases the max health, so it's a good trade i guess :P</li>
        <li>Everytime Player heals fully from hospital, he loses some defence point, as he should. It is representing that we are actually a bit vulnurable after a such a huge recovery from hospital.</li>
        <li>Since the main character is a Doctor, so he gains a little bit defence everytime he visits the hospital.
        <li>Don't worry about anyone exploiting above hidden feature, we have taken care of that in maths. Of cource, if you decide to mess with the code then it's a different story :P</li>
        <li>No more spoilers, play and find out XD</li>
